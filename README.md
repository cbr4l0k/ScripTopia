This is just a bunch of scripts that range from daily usage (and fundamental 
part of my workflow) to scripts I use once everytime I config a new system.

**Current scripts:**

- `vpn_init`: script that identifies all of the vpn files with the following 
    regex: `~/Downloads/*.protonvpn.tcp.ovpn`. And help me configure them all 
    for at the same time **with the same password and user**, for easy use of
    `nmcli`.
